# Pomodoro App

## Description

The Pomodoro App is a productivity tool designed to help you manage your time effectively using the Pomodoro Technique. This method encourages focused work sessions followed by short breaks, improving concentration and reducing burnout. The app keeps tracks of your work and  you can create an study plan for a specific task. You also has a dashboard to keep track of your performance using statistics.

## Features

- **Customizable Timers**: Set your preferred durations for work sessions and breaks.
- **Task Management**: Add and track tasks to stay organized.
- **Notifications**: Receive alerts when a session or break ends.
- **Statistics**: View your productivity stats to monitor progress.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for ease of use.

## How It Works

1. Choose a task to work on.
2. Start a 25-minute Pomodoro session.

5. After completing 4 Pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes).
